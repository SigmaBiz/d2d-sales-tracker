## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test Google Maps Integration**
   - Set Google Maps API key in `.env`
   - Run `npx expo start` to test
   - Verify all map features work correctly

2. **Once Verified**
   - Merge `feature/google-maps-integration` → `develop`
   - Test thoroughly in develop
   - Create PR to merge `develop` → `main`

3. **Future Work**
   - Fix date offset bug in preprocessing (already documented)
   - Set up GitHub Actions for daily MRMS updates
   - Deploy updated MRMS proxy to production

## Safety Notes

All previous milestones are preserved:
- GRIB2 processing work is safe in its own branch
- Google Maps branch includes all previous work via merge
- No work has been lost - everything is tracked in Git history
