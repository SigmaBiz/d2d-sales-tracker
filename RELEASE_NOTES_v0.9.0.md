# Release v0.9.0 - Hail Intelligence Foundation

## Release Date: June 25, 2025

## Overview
This release establishes a stable foundation with core door-to-door canvassing functionality and introduces the first two tiers of the Hail Intelligence System. While Tier 3 (Storm Events validation) requires completion, the app is fully functional for field use.

## Status
- **Core Canvassing**: âœ… Stable and functional
- **Tier 1 (Real-time MRMS)**: âœ… Operational
- **Tier 2 (Historical GRIB2)**: âœ… Operational with preprocessed data
- **Tier 3 (Storm Events)**: ðŸš§ Needs completion

## Features Included

### Core Canvassing Functionality
- Door-to-door knock tracking with GPS location
- Multiple outcome types with visual indicators (emojis)
- Knock history per location
- Offline-first with AsyncStorage
- Cloud sync via Supabase
- Real-time stats tracking
- OpenStreetMap integration via WebView

### Hail Intelligence System (Tiers 1 & 2)
- **Tier 1**: Real-time NOAA MRMS data integration
  - Live hail size estimates
  - 5-minute update intervals
  - Visual contour overlays on map
  
- **Tier 2**: Historical GRIB2 data processing
  - 12 months of preprocessed data (372 dates)
  - 4,995 hail reports indexed
  - Date-based storm search
  - Hail size visualization

### Map Features
- OpenStreetMap/Leaflet implementation
- Colored pins with outcome emojis
- User location tracking (blue dot)
- Hail contour overlays
- Storm boundary visualization
- Address search functionality
- Satellite/street view toggle

### UI Components
- Bottom tab navigation
- Storm search screen
- Notification log panel
- Hail overlay panel
- Progressive knock workflow
- One tag per location system

## Known Limitations
1. **Tier 3 Integration**: Storm Events database validation not complete
2. **Performance**: Initial load time 3-5 seconds on some devices
3. **Background Tracking**: Limited in Expo Go (full functionality in standalone build)
4. **Map Performance**: WebView implementation has overhead vs native

## Technical Stack
- React Native with Expo SDK 53
- TypeScript
- OpenStreetMap via Leaflet WebView
- AsyncStorage for offline data
- Supabase for cloud sync
- NOAA MRMS data sources

## Deployment Information
- Bundle ID: `com.sigmabiz.d2dsalestracker`
- Tested on iOS via TestFlight
- Expo Go compatible for development

## Next Steps
1. Complete Tier 3 Storm Events integration
2. Optimize OpenStreetMap performance
3. Implement native maps for production build
4. Add team features and territory management

## Notes
- This version uses OpenStreetMap, not Google Maps
- The failed Google Maps integration has been documented
- All experimental features are included but stable
