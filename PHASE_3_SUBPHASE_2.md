# Phase 3 Subphase 2: RequestAnimationFrame for Smooth UI

## Date: January 3, 2025

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented requestAnimationFrame optimization for UI state updates that trigger visual changes.

### Changes Made

1. **Added RequestAnimationFrame to UI Toggles**
   - Notification panel toggle
   - Storm panel toggle
   - Map type toggle (street/satellite)
   - Show/hide cleared knocks toggle
   - All panel close handlers

2. **Added Feature Flag**
   - `USE_RAF_FOR_UI_UPDATES` in optimization.ts
   - All implementations check this flag
   - Can be disabled to compare performance

### How It Works

RequestAnimationFrame ensures state updates happen at the optimal time for browser rendering:
- Synchronizes with the browser's repaint cycle (typically 60fps)
- Reduces jank when toggling UI elements
- Improves perceived performance for panel animations
- Batches multiple updates together

### Implementation Pattern

```javascript
// With optimization enabled
if (OPTIMIZATIONS.USE_RAF_FOR_UI_UPDATES) {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setShowPanel(!showPanel);
  });
} else {
  // Original synchronous update
  setShowPanel(!showPanel);
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Smoother Animations**: UI state changes sync with browser rendering
2. **Reduced Jank**: Less frame drops when toggling panels
3. **Better User Experience**: More responsive feeling interface
4. **No Functional Changes**: Only timing of updates changed

### Testing

- Toggle panels with flag enabled vs disabled
- Notice smoother transitions with RAF enabled
- Verify all functionality remains identical
- Check that kill switch works properly

## Note on Clustering

The "Defer clustering calculations" task was marked complete as not applicable because:
- Clustering happens in the WebView (browser JavaScript)
- Not in React Native thread
- Already runs asynchronously in browser
- No optimization needed from React Native side
