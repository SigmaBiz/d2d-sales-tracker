# Render.com Container Analysis

## Known Constraints (from experience)

### Memory Limits
- **Free Tier**: 512MB RAM hard limit
- **Enforcement**: Aggressive - kills processes approaching limit
- **Monitoring**: RSS (Resident Set Size) is what matters
- **Behavior**: Process gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if not responsive

### From Error Messages
```
"Web Service d2d-dynamic-server exceeded its memory limit"
"[SKIP] Warning: Killed"
```

## Standard Practices for Large Data Processing

### 1. Streaming Architecture
- Never load entire datasets into memory
- Process data in chunks
- Use Node.js streams or similar patterns

### 2. External Processing
- Use external services for heavy computation
- Cache results aggressively
- Separate data processing from serving

### 3. Binary Optimization
- Avoid text parsing when possible
- Use binary formats for efficiency
- Minimize data transformation steps

### 4. Container-Aware Design
- Monitor memory usage continuously
- Implement backpressure mechanisms
- Graceful degradation under load

## What Render Expects

### For Data Processing Services
1. **Stateless operations** - No large in-memory state
2. **Horizontal scaling** - Design for multiple instances
3. **Quick responses** - Timeout limits exist
4. **Efficient resource usage** - Optimize for containers

### Best Practices
1. **Pre-process offline** when possible
2. **Use CDN/storage** for large files
3. **Stream everything** - never buffer
4. **Cache aggressively** - compute once

## The Mismatch

Our current approach:
- Requires processing 24.5M data points
- Uses shell commands that buffer data
- Relies on tools not optimized for containers

What Render expects:
- Lightweight, streaming operations
- Minimal memory footprint
- Container-optimized tools

## Potential Solutions Within Render's Model

### 1. Two-Service Architecture
```
Service 1 (Background): Process GRIB2 daily, store results
Service 2 (API): Serve pre-processed data
```

### 2. External Processing
```
GitHub Actions: Process GRIB2 files daily
S3/CDN: Store processed JSON
Render: Serve cached data only
```

### 3. Streaming Binary Parser
```
Custom GRIB2 parser that:
- Seeks to specific byte offsets
- Reads only OKC data
- Never loads full dataset
```

### 4. Different Data Product
```
Find NOAA API that provides:
- Regional subsets
- Pre-filtered data
- JSON/CSV format
```

## The Reality Check

**Render's free tier is not designed for processing 24.5M data points**

Options:
1. Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month = 1GB RAM)
2. Pre-process data outside Render
3. Find a different data source
4. Build a custom streaming solution

## Recommended Approach

Given Render's constraints and our data needs:

1. **Short term**: Pre-process popular dates and cache
2. **Medium term**: Daily GitHub Actions to process and cache
3. **Long term**: Find or build a regional data API
