# OpenStreetMap Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Issues
- Initial map load: 3-5 seconds
- WebView overhead for all interactions
- Re-rendering inefficiencies
- Large marker datasets cause slowdowns
- Message passing latency between React Native and WebView

## Optimization Goals
1. Reduce initial load time to <1 second
2. Improve interaction responsiveness
3. Handle 1000+ markers efficiently
4. Minimize re-renders
5. Reduce memory footprint

## Proposed Optimizations

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
- [ ] Minimize HTML/CSS in WebView
- [ ] Implement marker clustering for large datasets
- [ ] Cache map tiles locally
- [ ] Defer non-critical map features
- [ ] Remove unnecessary console logs

### Phase 2: Data Optimization
- [ ] Implement viewport-based marker rendering
- [ ] Use virtual scrolling for marker lists
- [ ] Compress marker data format
- [ ] Batch WebView message updates
- [ ] Implement differential updates (add/remove/modify)

### Phase 3: Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Consider react-native-webview-leaflet for better integration
- [ ] Evaluate static tile serving
- [ ] Implement progressive map loading
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Consider Web Workers for heavy computations

### Phase 4: Alternative Approaches
- [ ] Evaluate react-native-maps with OpenStreetMap tiles
- [ ] Consider MapLibre GL Native
- [ ] Investigate offline map solutions
- [ ] Benchmark against other mapping libraries

## Success Metrics
- Time to interactive map: <1 second
- Smooth 60fps scrolling/zooming
- Handle 1000+ markers without lag
- Memory usage <100MB
- Battery impact minimal

## Testing Strategy
- Performance profiling with React DevTools
- Memory profiling with Xcode Instruments
- Real device testing (not just simulator)
- Load testing with various dataset sizes
- User perception testing

## Rollback Plan
- Keep current implementation as fallback
- Feature flag for new optimizations
- A/B testing capability
- Git tags for each optimization phase
