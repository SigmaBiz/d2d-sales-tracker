## üöÄ Performance Category

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Deferred Initialization (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Progressive Data Loading (COMPLETE)
- ‚è≥ Phase 3: Background Processing (NEXT)
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: Code Splitting
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Storage Optimization
- ‚è≥ Phase 6: Native Maps Migration

### Phase 3: Background Processing
- [x] Move contour generation to InteractionManager ‚úÖ
- [ ] Defer clustering calculations
- [ ] Implement request animation frame for smooth UI
- [ ] Profile and measure improvements

### Phase 4: Code Splitting
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components
- [ ] Dynamic imports for features
- [ ] Reduce initial bundle size
- [ ] Implement route-based splitting

### Phase 5: Storage Optimization
- [ ] Migrate to SQLite (overlaps with Data Preservation)
- [ ] Implement efficient queries
- [ ] Add database indexes
- [ ] Optimize data structures

### Phase 6: Native Maps Migration
- [ ] Replace WebView with react-native-maps
- [ ] Maintain feature parity
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Gradual rollout strategy

### Performance Metrics to Track
- App initialization time: <500ms ‚úÖ
- Time to first knock: ~100ms ‚úÖ
- Map render time: Target <1s
- Memory usage: Target <100MB
- Battery drain: Minimize background usage

  - [ ] Add deleted_at column
  - [ ] Update queries to filter
  - [ ] Create recovery UI
- [ ] Create backup/restore UI
  - [ ] Manual backup button
  - [ ] Restore from file
  - [ ] Progress indicators

### Phase 2: Security (Week 3-4)

  - [ ] Caching layer
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts
  - [ ] Data integrity checks
  - [ ] Backup success monitoring
  - [ ] Storage usage alerts

### Phase 4: Compliance (Month 3)
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA tools
  - [ ] Right to be forgotten
  - [ ] Data export API
  - [ ] Consent management
  - [ ] Auto-expiration
- [ ] Legal compliance features
  - [ ] Cooling-off period tracking
