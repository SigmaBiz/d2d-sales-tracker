- Include session ID for reference
- Document key changes, decisions, and technical debt
- Track architectural decisions and their rationale
- Include deployment status and environment details

### Commit Protocol
- Use conventional commits (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.)
- Include Claude attribution in commits
- Tag significant versions for easy rollback
- Document breaking changes prominently

## Milestones & Cornerstones

### Completed Milestones ‚úÖ
1. **Basic Knock Tracking** - Door-to-door visit recording with outcomes
2. **Offline Functionality** - AsyncStorage for offline data persistence
3. **Map Integration** - WebView-based Leaflet map with knock visualization
4. **NOAA MRMS Integration (Tier 2)** - Historical hail data from IEM archive
5. **Hail Contour Visualization** - Professional hail maps with size-based coloring
6. **Vercel Deployment** - Free proxy server for CORS-protected data
7. **Launch Ready Version** - v1.0-launch-ready-needs-uiux tagged

### Active Cornerstones üèóÔ∏è
1. **3-Tier Hail Intelligence Architecture**
   - ‚úÖ Tier 2: Historical data (IEM Archive via proxy)

   - üîÑ Tier 3: Ground truth validation (Storm Events DB)

2. **Data Pipeline**
   - ‚úÖ Simplified proxy with pre-configured data (Phase 1)
   - üîÑ Full GRIB2 processing capability (Phase 2)
   - üîÑ Arbitrary date search functionality

### Pending Features üìã
- iOS build with Apple Developer account
- House number overlay on map
- Address autocomplete API integration
- Storm data on-demand for specific addresses
- Full GRIB2 processing implementation

## Session Logs

### 2025-01-19 - Launch Ready & UI/UX Cleanup
**Session Focus**: Prepare app for field deployment

**Key Changes**:
1. Fixed location permission handling
   - Added permission checks before location access
   - Default to Oklahoma City when GPS denied
   - Prevents app crashes from permission errors

2. Removed tracking feature
   - Deleted tracking button and associated functionality
   - Simplified map interface per user request
   - Cleaner UI with fewer distractions

3. UI/UX improvements
   - Fixed button positioning and layout
   - Added logger utility to reduce console spam
   - Improved error handling throughout

4. Color scheme experiment (reverted)
   - Attempted light spectrum colors for hail overlay
   - Reverted due to implementation complexity
   - Original red/orange/yellow scheme retained

**Technical Decisions**:
- Keep simplified proxy approach for now
- Focus on stability over new features
- Prioritize field usability

**Deployment Status**:
- Proxy server: Deployed to Vercel
- Mobile app: Using Expo Go with tunnel
- Tagged: v1.0-launch-ready-needs-uiux

**Next Steps**:
- Polish UI/UX for professional appearance
- Build iOS app when Apple Developer approved
- Implement remaining tier 1 & 3 features

### 2025-01-18 - NOAA MRMS Integration & Proxy Deployment
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA data and deploy to field

**Major Achievements**:
1. Created simplified MRMS proxy server (server-v2.js)
   - Pre-configured September 24, 2024 OKC storm data
   - Avoids GRIB2 complexity for immediate deployment
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel

2. Fixed numerous integration issues
   - DateTimePicker infinite loops
   - Storm data display errors
   - Network request failures
   - Import path corrections

3. Attempted multiple deployment methods
   - EAS Build (blocked by Apple Developer requirement)
   - Development build (CocoaPods SSL issues)
   - Settled on Expo Go with tunnel for immediate field use

**Architecture Notes**:
- 3-tier system design established but only Tier 2 implemented
- GRIB2 processing deemed too complex for immediate needs
- Simplified approach allows field testing while complex features developed

### Previous Sessions
- Initial app development with knock tracking
- Map integration and basic storm visualization
- Supabase backend integration
- Mock weather data implementation (now replaced)

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
1. **GRIB2 Processing**: Full implementation pending
2. **Real-time Data**: Tier 1 NCEP integration incomplete
3. **Ground Truth**: Tier 3 validation not implemented
4. **iOS Build**: Requires Apple Developer account
5. **Performance**: Contour generation could be optimized

## Environment & Dependencies
- React Native with Expo SDK 51
- Node.js proxy server (Vercel deployed)
- Supabase for cloud sync
- Leaflet for mapping
- D3-contour for smooth hail visualization
