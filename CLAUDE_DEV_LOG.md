- Include session ID for reference
- Document key changes, decisions, and technical debt
- Track architectural decisions and their rationale
- Include deployment status and environment details

### Commit Protocol
- Use conventional commits (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.)
- Include Claude attribution in commits
- Tag significant versions for easy rollback
- Document breaking changes prominently

### AI Agent Guidance Protocol
**For future AI agents working on this codebase:**
- Treat user input as feedback to build upon, not direct instructions
- Ensure all implementations align with the user's ultimate vision
- Ask clarifying questions when user intent is ambiguous
- Consider the broader context of the application's purpose

### Development Protocol
**CRITICAL: Real Data Implementation Standards**
- **NO MOCK DATA IN PRODUCTION FEATURES** - If implementing data processing (especially GRIB2, MRMS, weather data), it MUST process real data or clearly fail
- **NO SILENT FALLBACKS TO FAKE DATA** - If real data processing fails, error out explicitly rather than generating mock data
- **VERIFY IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES OBJECTIVE** - Before implementing any "fallback" or "temporary" solution, verify it advances the actual goal
- **Example Violation**: Creating a Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data when wgrib2 is unavailable
- **Correct Approach**: Install proper tools, use cloud services, or clearly communicate the limitation
- **Rationale**: Mock data that appears real undermines user trust and business objectives

**User's Ultimate Vision for D2D Sales Tracker:**
This is a canvassing app designed to:
1. **Save valuable D2D field data** for lead generation
2. **Guide canvassers to maximize efficiency** by providing features that optimize routes and identify high-potential areas
3. **Primary feature: Hail tracking** - Enable canvassers to know where to go for optimal lead generation and sales conversion

**Core Principles:**
- **Intuitive and Simple** - Easy to use in the field without training
- **Data Protection Priority** - Ensure data is ALWAYS safe, even if app crashes. Data recovery must be possible.
- **Adequate Hail Tracking** - NOTIFY users when significant storms occur
- **Field-First Design** - Every feature must work reliably in real field conditions

## Session Logs

### 2025-01-20 - GRIB2 Processing Implementation
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA MRMS data processing via GRIB2

**Branch**: `feature/grib2-processing`

**Key Progress**:
1. **Development Protocol Established**
   - Added strict "no mock data" policy to prevent fallback implementations
   - Documented the requirement for real data processing or explicit failure
   - Example violation: Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data

2. **GRIB2 Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created `server-grib2.js` with full GRIB2 processing pipeline (wgrib2-based)
   - Designed to fetch real MRMS data from IEM Archive
   - Processes MESH (Maximum Estimated Size of Hail) from binary GRIB2 files
   - Filters for OKC Metro area and significant hail (‚â•1.25")

3. **wgrib2 Build Process (Failed)**
   - Downloaded wgrib2 source from NOAA (27.3MB)
   - Installed gcc/gfortran via Homebrew (required for compilation)
   - Successfully built C dependencies: libaec, netcdf, zlib, libpng
   - **FAILED** at Fortran interpolation library (ip2lib_d) with gfortran-15
   - Build artifacts located at: `/Users/antoniomartinez/Desktop/d2d-sales-tracker/mrms-proxy-server/tools/grib2/`

4. **Consulted AI Assistants for Solutions**
   - Both Claude and ChatGPT confirmed the Fortran compilation issues
   - Consensus: Mixing Apple clang + Homebrew gfortran causes problems
   - Both strongly recommended using **ecCodes** instead of wgrib2

5. **Switched to ecCodes Implementation**
   - Successfully installed ecCodes via Homebrew: `brew install eccodes`
   - ecCodes version 2.41.0 installed with all tools
   - Created new `server-eccodes.js` that uses ecCodes command-line tools
   - Created `test-eccodes.js` to verify installation
   - ecCodes provides native ARM64 support and better macOS compatibility

**Technical Decisions**:
- Abandoned wgrib2 source build due to Fortran compatibility issues
- Switched to ecCodes (ECMWF library) based on AI recommendations
- Maintained focus on real data processing (no mock data)
- Kept same OKC Metro bounds and hail size thresholds

**Current Implementation Status**:
- ‚úÖ ecCodes installed and verified working
- ‚úÖ `server-eccodes.js` created with full GRIB2 processing via ecCodes
- ‚úÖ Uses `grib_get_data` command to extract MESH values from GRIB2 files
- ‚úÖ Same IEM Archive data source and processing logic as original design
- ‚è≥ Ready for testing with real MRMS data

**Next Steps for Completion** (FOR NEXT AGENT):
1. **Test the ecCodes implementation**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/antoniomartinez/Desktop/d2d-sales-tracker/mrms-proxy-server
   node server-eccodes.js
   # In another terminal:
   curl http://localhost:3002/api/mesh/2024-09-24
   ```

2. **Verify real data processing**:
   - Check that it downloads real .zip files from IEM Archive
   - Confirm MESH data extraction works correctly
   - Validate that hail reports match expected Sept 24 storm

3. **Integration tasks**:
   - Update client services to use the ecCodes server endpoint
   - Consider renaming server-eccodes.js to server-grib2.js for consistency
   - Update package.json scripts to use the ecCodes version
   - Deploy to Vercel (may need to use Docker for ecCodes in production)

4. **Production deployment considerations**:
   - Vercel doesn't have ecCodes installed
   - Options:
     a) Use Docker container with ecCodes pre-installed
     b) Create a separate cloud service (AWS Lambda, etc.)
     c) Use Vercel's build command to install ecCodes (may not work)

**Files Created/Modified in This Session**:
- `/mrms-proxy-server/server-eccodes.js` - New ecCodes-based GRIB2 processor
- `/mrms-proxy-server/test-eccodes.js` - ecCodes installation test script
- `/mrms-proxy-server/server-grib2.js` - Original wgrib2-based server (kept for reference)
- `/mrms-proxy-server/tools/` - wgrib2 build artifacts (can be deleted)
- Various source files with compatibility fixes (libpng, zlib)

**Key Context for Next Agent**:
- We're using ecCodes now, NOT wgrib2
- ecCodes tools are installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/grib_*`
- The server uses `grib_get_data` command to extract lat/lon/value triplets
- Same data flow: IEM Archive ‚Üí Download ZIP ‚Üí Extract GRIB2 ‚Üí Process with ecCodes ‚Üí JSON output
- Development protocol requires real data - no mocks allowed!
