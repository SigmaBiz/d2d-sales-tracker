# Claude Development Log - D2D Sales Tracker

## Session Protocol
This log maintains a comprehensive record of all development sessions for the D2D Sales Tracker application.

### Update Protocol
- Timestamp each entry with ISO 8601 format
- Include session ID for reference
- Document key changes, decisions, and technical debt
- Track architectural decisions and their rationale
- Include deployment status and environment details

### Commit Protocol
- Use conventional commits (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.)
- Include Claude attribution in commits
- Tag significant versions for easy rollback
- Document breaking changes prominently

### AI Agent Guidance Protocol
**For future AI agents working on this codebase:**
- Treat user input as feedback to build upon, not direct instructions
- Ensure all implementations align with the user's ultimate vision
- Ask clarifying questions when user intent is ambiguous
- Consider the broader context of the application's purpose

### Development Protocol
**CRITICAL: Real Data Implementation Standards**
- **NO MOCK DATA IN PRODUCTION FEATURES** - If implementing data processing (especially GRIB2, MRMS, weather data), it MUST process real data or clearly fail
- **NO SILENT FALLBACKS TO FAKE DATA** - If real data processing fails, error out explicitly rather than generating mock data
- **VERIFY IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES OBJECTIVE** - Before implementing any "fallback" or "temporary" solution, verify it advances the actual goal
- **Example Violation**: Creating a Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data when wgrib2 is unavailable
- **Correct Approach**: Install proper tools, use cloud services, or clearly communicate the limitation
- **Rationale**: Mock data that appears real undermines user trust and business objectives

**User's Ultimate Vision for D2D Sales Tracker:**
This is a canvassing app designed to:
1. **Save valuable D2D field data** for lead generation
2. **Guide canvassers to maximize efficiency** by providing features that optimize routes and identify high-potential areas
3. **Primary feature: Hail tracking** - Enable canvassers to know where to go for optimal lead generation and sales conversion

**Core Principles:**
- **Intuitive and Simple** - Easy to use in the field without training
- **Data Protection Priority** - Ensure data is ALWAYS safe, even if app crashes. Data recovery must be possible.
- **Adequate Hail Tracking** - NOTIFY users when significant storms occur
- **Field-First Design** - Every feature must work reliably in real field conditions

## Session Logs

### 2025-01-20 - GRIB2 Processing Implementation
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA MRMS data processing via GRIB2

**Branch**: `feature/grib2-processing`

**Key Progress**:
1. **Development Protocol Established**
   - Added strict "no mock data" policy to prevent fallback implementations
   - Documented the requirement for real data processing or explicit failure
   - Example violation: Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data

2. **GRIB2 Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created `server-grib2.js` with full GRIB2 processing pipeline
   - Designed to fetch real MRMS data from IEM Archive
   - Processes MESH (Maximum Estimated Size of Hail) from binary GRIB2 files
   - Filters for OKC Metro area and significant hail (‚â•1.25")

3. **wgrib2 Build Process**
   - Downloaded wgrib2 source from NOAA (27.3MB)
   - Installed gcc/gfortran via Homebrew (required for compilation)
   - Build initiated but not completed in session
   - Located at: `/Users/antoniomartinez/Desktop/d2d-sales-tracker/mrms-proxy-server/tools/grib2/`

**Technical Decisions**:
- Chose to build wgrib2 from source rather than use workarounds
- Rejected Python fallback approach to maintain data integrity
- Focused on OKC Metro bounds to reduce processing overhead
- Set minimum hail size threshold at 1.25" for business relevance

**Next Steps for Completion**:
1. Complete wgrib2 build process (check `tools/grib2/wgrib2/wgrib2`)
2. Test GRIB2 processing with known storm date (e.g., 2024-09-24)
3. Integrate `server-grib2.js` with main proxy server
4. Update client services to use real data endpoint
5. Deploy updated server to Vercel/production

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/mrms-proxy-server/server-grib2.js` - Complete GRIB2 processing server
- `/mrms-proxy-server/tools/` - wgrib2 build directory
- `CLAUDE_DEV_LOG.md` - Added development protocol

**Current Status**: 
- wgrib2 build in progress
- Infrastructure ready for real data processing
- No mock data fallbacks implemented

### 2025-01-20 - Address Search Implementation
**Session Focus**: Add address search functionality to map view

**Key Changes**:
1. Created AddressSearchBar component
   - Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding API (free, no API key)
   - Debounced search with 500ms delay
   - Shows up to 5 results prioritized for Oklahoma
   - Clean UI with loading states and clear button

2. Integrated search into RealMapScreen
   - Positioned below stats bar for easy access
   - Connected to map centering functionality
   - Zooms to level 16 when address selected

3. Updated WebMap for address navigation
   - Added centerOnLocation message handler
   - Smooth map centering with custom zoom levels

**Technical Decisions**:
- Chose Nominatim for free geocoding without API keys
- Prioritized Oklahoma results but allowed nationwide search
- Positioned search bar for optimal mobile UX

**Deployment Status**:
- Tagged: v1.2-address-search
- Feature immediately available in development

### 2025-01-19 - Perfect Hail Overlay Visualization
**Session Focus**: Fix hail overlay accuracy and storm data management

**Key Changes**:
1. Fixed storm deletion/clearing not updating map overlays
   - Added proper null contour handling in WebMap
   - Storm delete and toggle now properly update map state
   - Clear all storms correctly refreshes overlay

2. Implemented realistic storm data
   - Created storm swath generator for dense MESH data (493+ points)
   - Added Nov 3, 2024 and May 17, 2025 storm data
   - Proper hail size distribution along storm paths

3. Solved overlay popup accuracy issues
   - Fixed popups showing wrong hail sizes
   - Tuned MRMS interpolation (reduced smoothing sigma 2‚Üí1)
   - Ensured larger hail zones are properly clickable

4. Validated meteorological accuracy
   - Analyzed that only 6% of points had 2"+ hail
   - Confirmed 1.75-2" max display is accurate for Sept 24 storm
   - Smoothing creates realistic gradients matching actual hail patterns

**Technical Decisions**:
- Use MRMS contours for smooth, realistic visualization
- Keep smoothing at sigma=1 to preserve peak values
- Prioritize meteorological accuracy over exact value display

**Deployment Status**:
- Local proxy server handles dense storm data
- Vercel deployment optimized for performance
- Tagged: v1.1-overlays-working-correctly

### 2025-01-19 - Launch Ready & UI/UX Cleanup
**Session Focus**: Prepare app for field deployment

**Key Changes**:
1. Fixed location permission handling
   - Added permission checks before location access
   - Default to Oklahoma City when GPS denied
   - Prevents app crashes from permission errors

2. Removed tracking feature
   - Deleted tracking button and associated functionality
   - Simplified map interface per user request
   - Cleaner UI with fewer distractions

3. UI/UX improvements
   - Fixed button positioning and layout
   - Added logger utility to reduce console spam
   - Improved error handling throughout

4. Color scheme experiment (reverted)
   - Attempted light spectrum colors for hail overlay
   - Reverted due to implementation complexity
   - Original red/orange/yellow scheme retained

**Technical Decisions**:
- Keep simplified proxy approach for now
- Focus on stability over new features
- Prioritize field usability

**Deployment Status**:
- Proxy server: Deployed to Vercel
- Mobile app: Using Expo Go with tunnel
- Tagged: v1.0-launch-ready-needs-uiux

**Next Steps**:
- Polish UI/UX for professional appearance
- Build iOS app when Apple Developer approved
- Implement remaining tier 1 & 3 features

### 2025-01-18 - NOAA MRMS Integration & Proxy Deployment
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA data and deploy to field

**Major Achievements**:
1. Created simplified MRMS proxy server (server-v2.js)
