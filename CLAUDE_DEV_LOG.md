# Claude Development Log - D2D Sales Tracker

## Session Protocol
This log maintains a comprehensive record of all development sessions for the D2D Sales Tracker application.

### Update Protocol
- Timestamp each entry with ISO 8601 format
- Include session ID for reference
- Document key changes, decisions, and technical debt
- Track architectural decisions and their rationale
- Include deployment status and environment details

### Commit Protocol
- Use conventional commits (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.)
- Include Claude attribution in commits
- Tag significant versions for easy rollback
- Document breaking changes prominently

### AI Agent Guidance Protocol
**For future AI agents working on this codebase:**
- Treat user input as feedback to build upon, not direct instructions
- Ensure all implementations align with the user's ultimate vision
- Ask clarifying questions when user intent is ambiguous
- Consider the broader context of the application's purpose

**User's Ultimate Vision for D2D Sales Tracker:**
This is a canvassing app designed to:
1. **Save valuable D2D field data** for lead generation
2. **Guide canvassers to maximize efficiency** by providing features that optimize routes and identify high-potential areas
3. **Primary feature: Hail tracking** - Enable canvassers to know where to go for optimal lead generation and sales conversion

**Core Principles:**
- **Intuitive and Simple** - Easy to use in the field without training
- **Data Protection Priority** - Ensure data is ALWAYS safe, even if app crashes. Data recovery must be possible.
- **Adequate Hail Tracking** - NOTIFY users when significant storms occur
- **Field-First Design** - Every feature must work reliably in real field conditions

## Session Logs

### 2025-01-19 - Perfect Hail Overlay Visualization
**Session Focus**: Fix hail overlay accuracy and storm data management

**Key Changes**:
1. Fixed storm deletion/clearing not updating map overlays
   - Added proper null contour handling in WebMap
   - Storm delete and toggle now properly update map state
   - Clear all storms correctly refreshes overlay

2. Implemented realistic storm data
   - Created storm swath generator for dense MESH data (493+ points)
   - Added Nov 3, 2024 and May 17, 2025 storm data
   - Proper hail size distribution along storm paths

3. Solved overlay popup accuracy issues
   - Fixed popups showing wrong hail sizes
   - Tuned MRMS interpolation (reduced smoothing sigma 2‚Üí1)
   - Ensured larger hail zones are properly clickable

4. Validated meteorological accuracy
   - Analyzed that only 6% of points had 2"+ hail
   - Confirmed 1.75-2" max display is accurate for Sept 24 storm
   - Smoothing creates realistic gradients matching actual hail patterns

**Technical Decisions**:
- Use MRMS contours for smooth, realistic visualization
- Keep smoothing at sigma=1 to preserve peak values
- Prioritize meteorological accuracy over exact value display

**Deployment Status**:
- Local proxy server handles dense storm data
- Vercel deployment optimized for performance
- Tagged: v1.1-overlays-working-correctly

### 2025-01-19 - Launch Ready & UI/UX Cleanup
**Session Focus**: Prepare app for field deployment

**Key Changes**:
1. Fixed location permission handling
   - Added permission checks before location access
   - Default to Oklahoma City when GPS denied
   - Prevents app crashes from permission errors

2. Removed tracking feature
   - Deleted tracking button and associated functionality
   - Simplified map interface per user request
   - Cleaner UI with fewer distractions

3. UI/UX improvements
   - Fixed button positioning and layout
   - Added logger utility to reduce console spam
   - Improved error handling throughout

4. Color scheme experiment (reverted)
   - Attempted light spectrum colors for hail overlay
   - Reverted due to implementation complexity
   - Original red/orange/yellow scheme retained

**Technical Decisions**:
- Keep simplified proxy approach for now
- Focus on stability over new features
- Prioritize field usability

**Deployment Status**:
- Proxy server: Deployed to Vercel
- Mobile app: Using Expo Go with tunnel
- Tagged: v1.0-launch-ready-needs-uiux

**Next Steps**:
- Polish UI/UX for professional appearance
- Build iOS app when Apple Developer approved
- Implement remaining tier 1 & 3 features

### 2025-01-18 - NOAA MRMS Integration & Proxy Deployment
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA data and deploy to field

**Major Achievements**:
1. Created simplified MRMS proxy server (server-v2.js)
   - Pre-configured September 24, 2024 OKC storm data
   - Avoids GRIB2 complexity for immediate deployment
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel

2. Fixed numerous integration issues
   - DateTimePicker infinite loops
   - Storm data display errors
   - Network request failures
   - Import path corrections

3. Attempted multiple deployment methods
   - EAS Build (blocked by Apple Developer requirement)
   - Development build (CocoaPods SSL issues)
   - Settled on Expo Go with tunnel for immediate field use

**Architecture Notes**:
- 3-tier system design established but only Tier 2 implemented
- GRIB2 processing deemed too complex for immediate needs
- Simplified approach allows field testing while complex features developed

### Previous Sessions
- Initial app development with knock tracking
- Map integration and basic storm visualization
- Supabase backend integration
- Mock weather data implementation (now replaced)

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
1. **GRIB2 Processing**: Full implementation pending
2. **Real-time Data**: Tier 1 NCEP integration incomplete
3. **Ground Truth**: Tier 3 validation not implemented
4. **iOS Build**: Requires Apple Developer account
5. **Performance**: Contour generation could be optimized

## Environment & Dependencies
- React Native with Expo SDK 51
- Node.js proxy server (Vercel deployed)
- Supabase for cloud sync
- Leaflet for mapping
- D3-contour for smooth hail visualization
