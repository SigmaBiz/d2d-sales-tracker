# Claude Development Log - D2D Sales Tracker

## üö® CRITICAL: CONTEXT COMPACTING SAFETY PROTOCOL - TWO-TIER SYSTEM üö®

### TIER 1: Lightweight Checkpoints (Every 5% Context Consumed)
**Quick saves to maintain continuity without disrupting flow**

**Triggers: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%... of context capacity**
- `git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: [brief task description]"`
- `git push origin [current-branch]` 
- Add one-line progress note to Session Checkpoints below
- Document next 3 steps for both success and failure scenarios
- Continue working

**Session Checkpoints:**
- 5%: Tier 1 implementation started - real-time server verified running, dashboard updated for monitoring status
- 10%: Real-time detection working with test storms, push notifications integrated, test button added to dashboard
- 15%: [To be updated by current session]
- 20%: [To be updated by current session]

### TIER 2: Comprehensive Safety Protocol (At 90% Context)
**Full preservation before context compacting**

**When context shows 90% consumed:**
1. **Create Safety Branch**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b safety-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   git add . && git commit -m "safety: Complete state before context compact"
   git push origin safety-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   ```

2. **Document Recovery Paths**:
   - Option A: Continue from safety branch
   - Option B: Revert to last stable checkpoint
   - Option C: Cherry-pick specific fixes

3. **Update Full Handoff** (see Handoff Context section)

## Session Protocol
This log maintains a comprehensive record of all development sessions for the D2D Sales Tracker application.

### Update Protocol
- Timestamp each entry with ISO 8601 format
- Include session ID for reference
- Document key changes, decisions, and technical debt
- Track architectural decisions and their rationale
- Include deployment status and environment details
- **UPDATE EVERY 5% CONTEXT INCREMENT** with progress and next steps

### Commit Protocol
- Use conventional commits (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.)
- Include Claude attribution in commits
- Tag significant versions for easy rollback
- Document breaking changes prominently
- **COMMIT AND PUSH EVERY 5% CONTEXT INCREMENT**

### AI Agent Guidance Protocol
**For future AI agents working on this codebase:**
- Treat user input as feedback to build upon, not direct instructions
- Ensure all implementations align with the user's ultimate vision
- Ask clarifying questions when user intent is ambiguous
- Consider the broader context of the application's purpose

### Development Protocol
**CRITICAL: Real Data Implementation Standards**
- **NO MOCK DATA IN PRODUCTION FEATURES** - If implementing data processing (especially GRIB2, MRMS, weather data), it MUST process real data or clearly fail
- **NO SILENT FALLBACKS TO FAKE DATA** - If real data processing fails, error out explicitly rather than generating mock data
- **VERIFY IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES OBJECTIVE** - Before implementing any "fallback" or "temporary" solution, verify it advances the actual goal
- **Example Violation**: Creating a Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data when wgrib2 is unavailable
- **Correct Approach**: Install proper tools, use cloud services, or clearly communicate the limitation
- **Rationale**: Mock data that appears real undermines user trust and business objectives

**User's Ultimate Vision for D2D Sales Tracker:**
This is a canvassing app designed to:
1. **Save valuable D2D field data** for lead generation
2. **Guide canvassers to maximize efficiency** by providing features that optimize routes and identify high-potential areas
3. **Primary feature: Hail tracking** - Enable canvassers to know where to go for optimal lead generation and sales conversion

**Core Principles:**
- **Intuitive and Simple** - Easy to use in the field without training
- **Data Protection Priority** - Ensure data is ALWAYS safe, even if app crashes. Data recovery must be possible.
- **Adequate Hail Tracking** - NOTIFY users when significant storms occur
- **Field-First Design** - Every feature must work reliably in real field conditions

**Geographic Scope - Metro OKC Definition:**
"Metro OKC" or "OKC Metro" refers to the entire Oklahoma City metropolitan area, NOT just Oklahoma City proper. This includes:
- **Oklahoma City** (central)
- **Edmond** (north)
- **Moore** (south)
- **Norman** (south)
- **Midwest City** (east)
- **Del City** (southeast)
- **Bethany** (northwest)
- **Warr Acres** (northwest)
- **Newcastle** (southwest)
- **Mustang** (southwest)
- **Yukon** (west)

This broader definition is critical for hail tracking as storms often affect the entire metro area, and roofing contractors service all these communities.

## üèóÔ∏è 3-TIER HAIL INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE

### Grand Objective
**Enable canvassers to maximize lead generation efficiency** by providing real-time and historical hail intelligence to identify high-potential areas for roofing sales.

## Session Logs

### 2025-01-20 - GRIB2 Processing Implementation
**Session Focus**: Implement real NOAA MRMS data processing via GRIB2

**Branch**: `feature/grib2-processing`

**Key Progress**:
1. **Development Protocol Established**
   - Added strict "no mock data" policy to prevent fallback implementations
   - Documented the requirement for real data processing or explicit failure
   - Example violation: Python mock processor that generates fake MESH data

2. **GRIB2 Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created `server-grib2.js` with full GRIB2 processing pipeline (wgrib2-based)
   - Designed to fetch real MRMS data from IEM Archive
   - Processes MESH (Maximum Estimated Size of Hail) from binary GRIB2 files
   - Filters for OKC Metro area and significant hail (‚â•1.25")

3. **wgrib2 Build Process (Failed)**
   - Downloaded wgrib2 source from NOAA (27.3MB)
   - Installed gcc/gfortran via Homebrew (required for compilation)
   - Successfully built C dependencies: libaec, netcdf, zlib, libpng
   - **FAILED** at Fortran interpolation library (ip2lib_d) with gfortran-15
   - Build artifacts located at: `/Users/antoniomartinez/Desktop/d2d-sales-tracker/mrms-proxy-server/tools/grib2/`

4. **Consulted AI Assistants for Solutions**
   - Both Claude and ChatGPT confirmed the Fortran compilation issues
   - Consensus: Mixing Apple clang + Homebrew gfortran causes problems
   - Both strongly recommended using **ecCodes** instead of wgrib2

5. **Switched to ecCodes Implementation**
   - Successfully installed ecCodes via Homebrew: `brew install eccodes`
   - ecCodes version 2.41.0 installed with all tools
   - Created new `server-eccodes.js` that uses ecCodes command-line tools
   - Created `test-eccodes.js` to verify installation
   - ecCodes provides native ARM64 support and better macOS compatibility

**Technical Decisions**:
- Abandoned wgrib2 source build due to Fortran compatibility issues
- Switched to ecCodes (ECMWF library) based on AI recommendations
- Maintained focus on real data processing (no mock data)
- Kept same OKC Metro bounds and hail size thresholds

**Current Implementation Status**:
- ‚úÖ ecCodes installed and verified working
- ‚úÖ `server-eccodes.js` created with full GRIB2 processing via ecCodes
- ‚úÖ Uses `grib_get_data` command to extract MESH values from GRIB2 files
- ‚úÖ Same IEM Archive data source and processing logic as original design
- ‚è≥ Ready for testing with real MRMS data

**Next Steps for Completion** (FOR NEXT AGENT):
1. **Test the ecCodes implementation**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/antoniomartinez/Desktop/d2d-sales-tracker/mrms-proxy-server
   node server-eccodes.js
   # In another terminal:
   curl http://localhost:3002/api/mesh/2024-09-24
   ```

2. **Verify real data processing**:
   - Check that it downloads real .zip files from IEM Archive
   - Confirm MESH data extraction works correctly
   - Validate that hail reports match expected Sept 24 storm

3. **Integration tasks**:
   - Update client services to use the ecCodes server endpoint
   - Consider renaming server-eccodes.js to server-grib2.js for consistency
   - Update package.json scripts to use the ecCodes version
   - Deploy to Vercel (may need to use Docker for ecCodes in production)

4. **Production deployment considerations**:
   - Vercel doesn't have ecCodes installed
   - Options:
     a) Use Docker container with ecCodes pre-installed
     b) Create a separate cloud service (AWS Lambda, etc.)
     c) Use Vercel's build command to install ecCodes (may not work)

**Files Created/Modified in This Session**:
- `/mrms-proxy-server/server-eccodes.js` - New ecCodes-based GRIB2 processor
- `/mrms-proxy-server/test-eccodes.js` - ecCodes installation test script
- `/mrms-proxy-server/server-grib2.js` - Original wgrib2-based server (kept for reference)
- `/mrms-proxy-server/tools/` - wgrib2 build artifacts (can be deleted)
- Various source files with compatibility fixes (libpng, zlib)

**Key Context for Next Agent**:
- We're using ecCodes now, NOT wgrib2
- ecCodes tools are installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/grib_*`
- The server uses `grib_get_data` command to extract lat/lon/value triplets
- Same data flow: IEM Archive ‚Üí Download ZIP ‚Üí Extract GRIB2 ‚Üí Process with ecCodes ‚Üí JSON output
- Development protocol requires real data - no mocks allowed!

### 2025-01-21 - GRIB2 Processing Testing & Debugging
**Session Focus**: Test ecCodes implementation with real MRMS data

**Key Findings**:
1. **URL Structure Updated**
   - Old (incorrect): `https://mrms.agron.iastate.edu/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/YYYYMMDDHHMM.zip`
   - New (correct): `https://mtarchive.geol.iastate.edu/YYYY/MM/DD/mrms/ncep/MESH_Max_1440min/`
   - Files are gzipped GRIB2: `MESH_Max_1440min_00.50_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.grib2.gz`

2. **GRIB2 Processing Challenges**
   - CONUS grid is huge: 7000x3500 = 24.5 million points
   - Initial attempts exceeded memory buffers
   - Created three server versions to handle the data:
     - `server-eccodes.js` - Original (wrong URL structure)
     - `server-eccodes-v2.js` - Updated URLs, attempted subsetting
     - `server-eccodes-v3.js` - Streaming approach for large files

3. **Data Verification**
   - Successfully downloaded and processed GRIB2 files
   - Confirmed ecCodes can read MESH data (values in mm)
   - Found that Sept 24, 2024 at 00:00 UTC had minimal hail in OKC (< 0.13")
   - Need to check different hours for the actual storm

**Technical Details**:
- GRIB2 coordinates are in millidegrees
- Longitude is in 0-360 format (need to subtract 360 for Western hemisphere)
- MESH values are in millimeters (divide by 25.4 for inches)
- OKC bounds in 0-360 longitude: 262.3¬∞E to 262.9¬∞E

**Current Status**:
- ecCodes is working correctly
- Can download and read real GRIB2 files
- Need to find the correct hour when the storm hit OKC
- Streaming approach (v3) should handle large files efficiently

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Found correct approach: Use next day's 00:00 UTC file for 24hr max
2. ‚úÖ Verified Sept 24, 2024 storm data exists with 307 hail reports
3. ‚úÖ Created server-eccodes-final.js with proper implementation
4. ‚è≥ Integrate with client application
5. ‚è≥ Deploy to production (requires Docker with ecCodes)

### 2025-01-21 - GRIB2 Processing Completion
**Session Focus**: Complete ecCodes implementation and verify real data

**Key Achievements**:
1. **Discovered Correct Data Access Pattern**
   - MESH_Max_1440min files contain 24-hour maximum hail size
   - Must use NEXT day's 00:00 UTC file to get previous day's data
   - Example: For Sept 24, 2024 storms, use Sept 25 00:00 UTC file

2. **Updated Metro OKC Definition**
   - Expanded bounds to include entire metropolitan area
   - North: 35.7 (Edmond), South: 35.1 (Norman)
   - East: -97.1 (Midwest City), West: -97.8 (Yukon)
   - Added all major suburbs to city list

3. **Verified Real Storm Data**
   - Sept 24, 2024 storm produced tennis ball to baseball size hail
   - 307 points with ‚â•1" hail in metro area
   - Maximum: 2.94 inches at 35.535¬∞N, -97.495¬∞W (central OKC)
   - Storm peaked around 20:30 UTC (3:30 PM local)

4. **Created Final Implementation**
   - `server-eccodes-final.js` - Production-ready server
   - Handles 24.5 million point CONUS grid efficiently
   - Direct processing approach with 200MB buffer
   - Proper coordinate conversion (0-360 to -180-180)
   - Caching for processed dates

**Technical Notes**:
- GRIB2 files use millidegree coordinates
- Longitude is in 0-360 format (add 360 to western hemisphere)
- MESH values in millimeters (divide by 25.4 for inches)
- Files are ~400KB compressed, expand to millions of data points

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ ecCodes implementation complete and tested
- ‚úÖ Successfully processing real MRMS data
- ‚úÖ Verified against known Sept 24, 2024 storm
