## Key Technical Decisions

### Storage Schema
- **Knocks**: Array of knock objects with id, location, outcome, timestamp, syncStatus
- **DailyStats**: Aggregated stats per day for performance tracking
- **Settings**: User preferences and configuration

### Location Strategy
- Foreground: High accuracy GPS for knock recording
- Background: Optional tracking with 5-second intervals
- Permissions: Properly configured for both iOS and Android

### Offline-First Design
- All data stored locally first
- Sync status tracked per record
- Backend sync prepared but not required for MVP

## Current State (as of latest update - 70% context)

3. Some location features restricted

### Supabase Configuration Required
To enable cloud storage:
1. Create free account at supabase.com
2. Run SQL setup from SUPABASE_SETUP.md
3. Update credentials in src/services/supabaseClient.ts
4. App works without this (local storage only)

## Running the App

- Physical device: Scan QR code with Expo Go

### Build Commands (Future)
```bash
# iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Android  
eas build --platform android
```

## Git Repository Setup Required

### Next Steps for GitHub:
1. Initialize git repository

## Current Issues & Debugging Steps

### WebView Map Loading Issue - RESOLVED ✅
**Problem**: The WebView-based map was experiencing flickering/reset issues after emoji updates.

**Solution Implemented**: Used React.useMemo to stabilize the HTML template and prevent recreation on every render. This fixed the flickering while keeping emoji support.

### New Features Implemented (Latest Session)
1. **Fixed Center-on-User Button** ✅
   - Added ref forwarding to WebMap component
   - Center button now immediately focuses on user's blue dot location
   
2. **Map Click to Create Knock** ✅
   - Click anywhere on map to navigate to Record Knock screen
   - Pre-fills location coordinates
   - Automatically fetches address for clicked location
   
3. **Satellite View Toggle** ✅
   - Added layer control to switch between Street and Satellite views
   - Satellite view shows roof structures for canvassing decisions
   - Uses Esri World Imagery tiles
   - Fixed positioning to appear below stats bar
   
4. **One Tag Per Location with History** ✅
   - Each address/location can only have one active tag
   - Previous knocks at same location are automatically replaced
   - Added "Edit" button to map popups for existing knocks
   - Clicking Edit navigates to Record Knock with pre-filled data
   - **Knock history tracking** - Shows previous outcomes in popup (e.g., "🪜 inspected - 1/14/2025")
   - Strategic implementation to minimize code changes
   
5. **Improved Save Workflow** ✅
   - **New knocks**: Save immediately without success prompt (faster workflow)
   - **Edit knocks**: Show confirmation dialog with Cancel/Update options
   - Button text changes to "Update Knock" when editing
   - Removed double success prompt after edit confirmation
   - Auto-navigate to map view after saving/updating
   - Map auto-refreshes when returning from knock screen
   - Added new "Conversation" outcome with 💬 icon (for when someone answers)
   - Reverted Follow Up icon back to 🔄
   - Reduced map tag size from 36px to 24px for better house proportion
   - Removed default white background from map markers
   - Cleaner map appearance with smaller, more precise tags
   
6. **Backup Solution Available**
   - WebMapSimple component available as fallback (simple dots, no emojis)
   - Can switch by editing import in RealMapScreen.tsx

**Debugging Steps Taken**:
1. Verified JavaScript execution (gray background = JS running)
2. Tested basic HTML rendering (confirmed working)
3. Added timeouts for Leaflet library loading
4. Simplified emoji set to avoid Unicode issues
5. Attempted to stabilize HTML template with refs

**Next Debugging Steps**:
1. **Fix the module export error**: Change WebMap back to default export
2. **Implement stable WebView pattern**: 
   - Create HTML once and use message passing for all updates
   - Avoid recreating map on each render
3. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Consider react-native-maps for production (requires standalone build)
   - Implement static image fallback for Expo Go
   - Use server-rendered map tiles
4. **Performance optimization**:
   - Debounce location updates
   - Batch knock updates
   - Cache map tiles locally

### Contact Form Integration Success
- Successfully implemented progressive workflow
- Calendly integration working with pre-filled customer data
- Email functionality ready for immediate contact info sharing
- Forms properly linked to knock locations

## Handoff Context

### Current Session Summary
- Implemented custom roofing sales workflow with specific emojis
- Added contact form system with Calendly integration
- Created progressive sales pipeline tracking
- Debugged WebView map issues (partially resolved)
- App functional but map needs stabilization

### Critical Files to Review
1. `App.tsx` - Entry point
2. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Navigation structure
3. `src/components/WebMap.tsx` - Map component (needs fixing)
4. `src/screens/KnockScreen.tsx` - Updated with sales pipeline
5. `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - New contact form system
6. `src/services/emailService.ts` - Email integration
7. `src/types/index.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces

### Environment Details
- Node version: Expected 14+
- Expo SDK: 51 (check package.json)
- React Native: Via Expo
- Platform: Cross-platform (iOS/Android)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] GPS permissions granted
