# D2D Sales Tracker - Development Log

## Constitution of Development

The D2D Sales Tracker is built on core principles that guide every development decision:

**Core Mission**: We want an app that helps us track d2d data kinda like a crm but for door to door outcomes, notes, history which is dynamic, easy to use and which gives user insights from the d2d data such as sales analytics. The hail tiered system is supposed to optimize conversion for the canvassing app to expedite the scouting process and help the user arrive to the correct location where hail has occurred and which provides live notifications for events as they happen, historical data, and verified landed hail reports. The app is intended to keep d2d users organized, optimized, alert, and effective.

## üö® CRITICAL: CONTEXT COMPACTING SAFETY PROTOCOL - TWO-TIER SYSTEM üö®

### TIER 1: Lightweight Checkpoints (Every 5% Context Consumed)
**Quick saves to maintain continuity without disrupting flow**

**Triggers: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%... of context capacity**
- `git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: [brief task description]"`
- `git push origin feature/hail-intelligence-v0.9` 
- Add one-line progress note to Session Checkpoints below
- Continue working

**Session Checkpoints:**
- 5%: Initial handoff, identified SearchScreen implementation missing from git
- 10%: Reverted to stable commit 5feb54d, fixed HailOverlay peakSize‚ÜímaxSize crash
- 15%: Fixed IEM service CORS errors, updated to use MRMS proxy (commit 2989053)
- 20%: Fixed storm date search proxy conversion, verified Sept 24 data available (commit 65e80b3)
- 25%: Storm search fully functional, dates display correctly, pushed to origin (commit 90ed7a0)
- 30%: Tier 2 mock implementation complete with IEMArchiveService (commit 188d706)
- 35%: Tier 2 proxy server created, debugging method name mismatch (commit 9a7adfb)

### TIER 2: Comprehensive Safety Protocol (At 90% Context)
**Full preservation before context compacting**

**When context shows 90% consumed:**
1. **Create Safety Branch**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b safety-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   git add . && git commit -m "safety: Complete state before context compact"
   git push origin safety-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   ```

2. **Document Recovery Paths**:
   - Option A: Continue from safety branch
   - Option B: Revert to last stable checkpoint
   - Option C: Cherry-pick specific fixes

3. **Update Full Handoff** (see Handoff Context section)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è
**WE ARE DEVELOPING IN THE TERMINAL, NOT A WEB BROWSER**
- **DO NOT restart expo** - Already running on port 8081
- **DO NOT use browser debugging** - Terminal only
- **App runs on physical device via Expo Go**
- **Check existing terminal for logs**

### üîß TEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS - MUST RESTORE BEFORE PRODUCTION üîß
**These settings have been modified to reduce console logs during development:**

1. **MRMS Update Interval** (src/services/mrmsService.ts:51)
   - Current: `4 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (4 hours)
   - Production: `5 * 60 * 1000` (5 minutes)
   - Reason: Reduce console spam during development

2. **GPS Location Updates** (src/screens/RealMapScreen.tsx:20)
   - Current: `DEV_DISABLE_GPS_UPDATES = true`
   - Production: `DEV_DISABLE_GPS_UPDATES = false`
   - Reason: Disable frequent location updates during development

**REMEMBER: Before production deployment, restore these settings to their original values!**

### Current Branch Status
- **Branch**: feature/hail-intelligence-v0.9 (detached HEAD at 9a7adfb)
- **Unpushed**: 0 commits (synced with origin)
- **Uncommitted**: None (working directory clean)
- **Remote**: origin/feature/hail-intelligence-v0.9 at 9a7adfb
- **Latest commit**: 9a7adfb checkpoint: Tier 2 proxy integration debugging

### Proxy Server Status
- **Location**: /mrms-proxy-server
- **Running on**: http://localhost:3001
- **Device Access**: http://192.168.1.111:3001
- **Status**: Running with nodemon, receiving requests for 2025 dates
- **Issue**: Sept 24 searches not reaching proxy due to method name mismatch

### Protocol Adaptation for D2D Sales Tracker
**Project-Specific Guidelines:**
- **Feature Branches**: Always checkpoint before major UI changes (SearchScreen, navigation)
- **Hail Intelligence**: Create safety branches before modifying MRMS/weather services
- **Mobile Testing**: Checkpoint after confirming Expo Go functionality
- **Priority Files**: Always include WebMap.tsx, mrmsService.ts in safety commits
- **Recovery Strategy**: Prefer reverting to last stable map state over experimental fixes

## Current Issues & Debugging Steps

### WebView Map Loading Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The WebView-based map was experiencing flickering/reset issues after emoji updates.

**Solution Implemented**: Used React.useMemo to stabilize the HTML template and prevent recreation on every render. This fixed the flickering while keeping emoji support.

### New Features Implemented (Latest Session)
1. **Fixed Center-on-User Button** ‚úÖ
   - Added ref forwarding to WebMap component
   - Center button now immediately focuses on user's blue dot location
   
2. **Map Click to Create Knock** ‚úÖ
   - Click anywhere on map to navigate to Record Knock screen
   - Pre-fills location coordinates
   - Automatically fetches address for clicked location
   
3. **Satellite View Toggle** ‚úÖ
   - Added layer control to switch between Street and Satellite views
   - Satellite view shows roof structures for canvassing decisions
   - Uses Esri World Imagery tiles
   - Fixed positioning to appear below stats bar
   
4. **One Tag Per Location with History** ‚úÖ
   - Each address/location can only have one active tag
   - Previous knocks at same location are automatically replaced
   - Added "Edit" button to map popups for existing knocks
   - Clicking Edit navigates to Record Knock with pre-filled data
   - **Knock history tracking** - Shows previous outcomes in popup (e.g., "ü™ú inspected - 1/14/2025")
   - Strategic implementation to minimize code changes
   
5. **Improved Save Workflow** ‚úÖ
   - **New knocks**: Save immediately without success prompt (faster workflow)
   - **Edit knocks**: Show confirmation dialog with Cancel/Update options
   - Button text changes to "Update Knock" when editing
   - Removed double success prompt after edit confirmation
   - Auto-navigate to map view after saving/updating
   - Map auto-refreshes when returning from knock screen
   - Added new "Conversation" outcome with üí¨ icon (for when someone answers)
   - Reverted Follow Up icon back to üîÑ
   - Reduced map tag size from 36px to 24px for better house proportion
   - Removed default white background from map markers
   - Cleaner map appearance with smaller, more precise tags
   
6. **Backup Solution Available**
   - WebMapSimple component available as fallback (simple dots, no emojis)
   - Can switch by editing import in RealMapScreen.tsx

**Debugging Steps Taken**:
1. Verified JavaScript execution (gray background = JS running)
2. Tested basic HTML rendering (confirmed working)
3. Added timeouts for Leaflet library loading
4. Simplified emoji set to avoid Unicode issues
5. Attempted to stabilize HTML template with refs

**Next Debugging Steps**:
1. **Fix the module export error**: Change WebMap back to default export
2. **Implement stable WebView pattern**: 
   - Create HTML once and use message passing for all updates
   - Avoid recreating map on each render
3. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Consider react-native-maps for production (requires standalone build)
   - Implement static image fallback for Expo Go
   - Use server-rendered map tiles
4. **Performance optimization**:
   - Debounce location updates
   - Batch knock updates
   - Cache map tiles locally

### Contact Form Integration Success
- Successfully implemented progressive workflow
- Calendly integration working with pre-filled customer data
- Email functionality ready for immediate contact info sharing
- Forms properly linked to knock locations

## Handoff Context

### Agent Handoff Protocol
When context reaches critical levels or a new agent takes over:

1. **Read the DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** to get full project context and nuance
2. **Summarize your interpretation** of the project's overarching objective
3. **Confirm understanding** before proceeding with execution
4. **Use TodoRead** to check current task status
5. **Continue from in-progress tasks** rather than starting new work

This ensures continuity and prevents duplicate or conflicting implementations.

## Project Context

### üéØ CORNERSTONE: Professional-Grade Hail Intelligence System üéØ
**Replace fake "MRMS" (WeatherAPI.com) with real NOAA MRMS/MESH data**

### üìç MILESTONES - Three-Tier Data Flow Architecture üìç

#### **TIER 1: Real-Time Storm Detection**
- [ ] Remove WeatherAPI.com dependencies completely
- [ ] Implement NCEP MRMS real-time feed (GRIB2 format)
- [ ] Process MESH values every 2 minutes
- [ ] Create live hail overlays with confidence scoring
- [ ] Push immediate alerts for active storms

```
Data Flow: NOAA MRMS Real-Time ‚Üí MESH Processing ‚Üí Live Overlays ‚Üí Alerts
```

#### **TIER 2: Historical Data Archive** ‚ö° **CURRENT FOCUS**
- [x] Access Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) archive (URL structure done)
- [x] Create IEMArchiveService for historical MESH data
- [ ] Implement GRIB2 file processing (needs proxy server)
- [ ] Extract MESH values from meteorological format
- [x] Enable September 24, 2024 storm data access (mock data working)
- [ ] Support date range: October 2019 - Present (structure ready, needs real data)

```
Data Flow: IEM Archive ‚Üí Historical MESH ‚Üí Sept 2024 Data ‚Üí Territory Planning
```

#### **TIER 3: Ground Truth Validation**
- [ ] Integrate NOAA Storm Events Database
- [ ] Compare predictions with actual damage reports
- [ ] Build accuracy scoring system
- [ ] Create feedback loop for algorithm improvement
- [ ] Generate professional credibility metrics

```
Data Flow: Storm Events DB ‚Üí Actual Reports ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Accuracy Improvement
```

### Current Session Summary (Updated per Tier 1 Protocol)
**Context Usage**: ~35% (Last checkpoint completed)
**Branch State**: Detached HEAD at 9a7adfb
**Session Progress**:
- Storm search and display fully functional
- Fixed date display issues with local timezone
- Added "Clear All Storms" button
- Disabled GPS updates for development
- Created IEMArchiveService for Tier 2 implementation
- Built MRMS proxy server for GRIB2 processing
- **DEBUGGING**: Sept 24 searches not routing through proxy (fetchHistoricalStorm vs fetchHistoricalMESH)

### üêõ Active Debug Issue - Tier 2 Proxy Integration
**Problem**: Storm searches for Sept 24, 2024 are using mock data instead of proxy
**Root Cause**: WeatherHistoryService was calling `fetchHistoricalStorm` but IEMArchiveService only has `fetchHistoricalMESH`
**Status**: Fixed method name, needs testing
**Next Steps**: 
1. Reload app and test Sept 24 search
2. Verify proxy receives request for 2024-09-24
3. Check date formatting (Sept 24 showing as Sept 23 in some logs)

### Critical Files to Review
1. `App.tsx` - Entry point
2. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Navigation structure
3. `src/components/WebMap.tsx` - Map component (needs fixing)
4. `src/screens/KnockScreen.tsx` - Updated with sales pipeline
5. `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - New contact form system
6. `src/services/emailService.ts` - Email integration
7. `src/types/index.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces

### Environment Details
- Node version: Expected 14+
- Expo SDK: 51 (check package.json)
- React Native: Via Expo
- Platform: Cross-platform (iOS/Android)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] GPS permissions granted
- [ ] Knock recording saves correctly
- [ ] Map displays all knocks
- [ ] Stats calculate accurately
- [ ] Offline functionality works
- [ ] Settings persist

## Real-Time MRMS Data Integration Decision (2025-01-16)

### Three-Agent Analysis Results

**Agent Consensus**: Implement Hybrid Progressive Strategy using WeatherAPI.com

#### Agent 1 (Technical Architecture) Findings:
- CORS blocks direct NOAA access from browsers
- GRIB2 binary format incompatible with client-side parsing
- Commercial APIs provide best technical solution (8.5/10 merit)

#### Agent 2 (Business & UX) Findings:
- Mock data causes wasted trips (poor ROI)
- Real-time data = 10x conversion rate improvement
- $65/month cost justified by single extra sale
- Hybrid progressive approach: 10/10 business value

#### Agent 3 (Risk & Security) Findings:
- WeatherAPI.com lowest risk (4.5/10)
- Phased approach minimizes implementation risk
- No sensitive data exposure
- Clear upgrade path

### Decision: WeatherAPI.com Integration

**Free Tier Analysis**:
- 1M API calls/month
- Supports ~2,000 active users (500 calls/user/month)
- Current need: <10 users = 0.5% of capacity

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Phase 1: WeatherAPI.com direct integration (1-2 weeks)
2. Phase 2: Proxy server with caching (month 2-3)
3. Phase 3: Advanced features (month 4+)

### Next Steps - SUCCESS Scenario:
1. Deploy WeatherAPI integration to production
2. Monitor API usage and validate data accuracy
3. Begin Phase 2 proxy server development

### Next Steps - FAILURE Scenario:
1. Revert to enhanced mock data with user notification
2. Investigate alternative weather APIs (Xweather, Visual Crossing)
3. Implement client-side caching to reduce API dependency

### Technical Architecture:

## Native Architecture Performance Discussion (2025-01-04)

### Context
After completing Phase 3 optimizations (background processing), we explored the concept of achieving "order of magnitude" performance improvements to make the app operate seamlessly, effortlessly, and flawlessly.

### Current Performance (v1.0-js-optimized)
- **Architecture**: React Native ‚Üí WebView ‚Üí Leaflet
- **Cold start**: 3-5 seconds  
- **Map load**: 1-2 seconds
- **Contour generation**: ~1.1s (now in background)
- **Max practical knocks**: ~1000 before sluggish

### Proposed Native Architecture (v2.0-native-planned)

#### Phase 8: Native Core Rewrite
- **Native Map Rendering**: Direct Metal/OpenGL rendering instead of WebView
- **Native Data Layer**: Direct SQLite with memory-mapped files
- **Native Business Logic**: Core operations in Swift/Kotlin
- **Expected**: 10-50x faster operations

#### Phase 9: Shared Native Components  
- **C++ Core Library**: Shared between iOS and Android
- **WebAssembly Fallback**: For web compatibility
- **Spatial indexing**: GPU-accelerated clustering

#### Phase 10: Predictive Performance
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-render based on user patterns
- **Edge Computing**: Process hail data at CDN
- **Intelligent Preloading**: AI-driven data preloading

#### Phase 11: Architectural Revolution
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events, compute views on demand
- **CQRS Implementation**: Separate read/write models
- **Reactive Streams**: Replace callbacks with streams

### Expected Performance Gains
- **Cold start**: <500ms (10x improvement)
- **Map render**: Instant (100x improvement)  
- **100k knocks**: Smooth operation (100x capacity)
- **Memory usage**: 10x reduction
- **Battery life**: Significantly improved

### Implementation Timeline Discussion
- Initial estimate: 10-12 months (unrealistic)
- Revised estimate: 3-4 weeks (more realistic given our 2-week development pace)
- Aggressive goal: 2 days for core improvements (native storage + basic map)
- Reality: Code can be written in hours, but building/testing takes time

### Testing Constraints
- **Expo Go limitation**: Does NOT support native modules
- **Solution**: EAS Development Builds
  - One-time setup: ~30-45 minutes
  - Hot reload for JavaScript changes (instant)
  - Rebuilds only for native changes (~10 min)
  - 95% of Expo Go convenience with native module support

### Key Preservation Strategy
Following our fortified protocol strictly:
- **Kill switches** for every native module
- **Exact same interfaces** (no API changes)
- **Preserve all 15 knock outcomes** exactly
- **No UI/UX changes** whatsoever
- **Fallback to JavaScript** always available

### Development Approach
1. Write native modules with feature flags
2. Test in EAS development builds
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. Instant rollback capability

The key insight: We're not changing WHAT the app does, only HOW it does it - making it orders of magnitude faster while preserving exact functionality.

## iOS Native Module Implementation (2025-01-04)

### Phase 8: Native Storage Module Progress

#### What Was Completed:
1. **Native Storage Module Created**
   - `D2DNativeStorage.swift` - Complete SQLite implementation for iOS
   - `D2DNativeStorage.m` - Objective-C bridge for React Native
   - Exact same interface as AsyncStorage - no API changes
   - Full kill switch support for instant fallback

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Native Module Test screen added to Settings
   - Performance comparison tools
   - Emergency kill switch functionality
   - Feature flags in `optimization.ts` (disabled by default)

3. **Native Module Manager**
   - Centralized management of all native modules
   - Automatic fallback to JavaScript implementations
   - iOS-only implementation for faster development

#### Build Process Challenge:
**Issue**: CocoaPods SSL certificate error preventing pod installation
```
SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed 
(unable to get local issuer certificate)
```

**Root Cause Found**: Homebrew's Ruby was missing certificate file
- System Ruby SSL worked fine
- CocoaPods uses Homebrew Ruby which pointed to non-existent cert file
- `/opt/homebrew/etc/ca-certificates/cert.pem` was missing

**Solution Applied**:
1. Diagnosed using systematic testing (not guessing):
   - `curl` worked fine with CDN
   - System Ruby SSL worked
   - Homebrew Ruby SSL failed
2. Fixed with: `brew postinstall ca-certificates`
3. This regenerated the missing certificate bundle
4. CocoaPods now successfully cloning specs repo (~2-3GB download)

#### Current Status:
- Native module code complete and added to Xcode project ‚úÖ
- SSL certificate issue resolved ‚úÖ
- CocoaPods installation completed successfully ‚úÖ
- All 104 dependencies installed ‚úÖ
- Xcode workspace created (D2DSalesTracker.xcworkspace) ‚úÖ
- iOS build encountering issues ‚ùå
  - Build fails with error code 65
  - Expo Configure script phase failing
  - Native modules require development build (not Expo Go)

#### What Was Accomplished:
1. Fixed SSL certificate error:
   - Root cause: Homebrew Ruby missing certificate file
   - Solution: `brew postinstall ca-certificates`
2. Switched to CocoaPods CDN source for faster installation
3. Successfully installed all pods including native modules
4. Native storage module files properly integrated:
   - D2DNativeStorage.swift (SQLite implementation)
   - D2DNativeStorage.m (Objective-C bridge)
   - Bridging header configured

#### Build Challenges:
- Development builds with native modules require:
  - Either EAS Build service (cloud)
  - Or local Xcode build setup
  - Cannot use Expo Go due to native code
- Current blocker: Expo Configure script failing in Xcode build

#### Next Steps:
1. Option A: Use EAS Build to create development build
   - Requires Apple Developer account for device builds
   - Simulator builds may work without account
2. Option B: Fix local Xcode build configuration
   - Debug the Expo Configure script issue
   - Manual build in Xcode with proper setup
3. Option C: Temporarily disable native modules
   - Test with JavaScript-only version first
   - Enable native modules after confirming base app works

## Git Commit & Checkpoint Protocol

### Standard Commits
After making changes:
1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "type: Description"`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin feature/hail-intelligence-v0.9`

### Checkpoint Tags (Version Control Milestones)
After significant features or stable states:
1. Create annotated tag: `git tag -a checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM -m "Description of checkpoint"`
2. Push tag to remote: `git push origin checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`

Example:
```bash
git tag -a checkpoint-20250116-1430 -m "3-tier intelligence complete, WeatherAPI removed"
git push origin checkpoint-20250116-1430
```

### Viewing Checkpoints
- List all checkpoints: `git tag -l "checkpoint-*"`
- Show checkpoint details: `git show checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- Checkout a checkpoint: `git checkout checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`

### Reverting to Checkpoint
If needed to restore a stable state:
```bash
git checkout checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM
git checkout -b recovery-from-checkpoint
```

### Checkpoint Naming Convention
Format: `checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- YYYY: Year (4 digits)
- MM: Month (2 digits)
- DD: Day (2 digits)
- HH: Hour in 24h format (2 digits)
- MM: Minutes (2 digits)

This follows semantic versioning principles while maintaining chronological ordering.
