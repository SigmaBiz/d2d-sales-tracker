# Data Source Comparison: WeatherAPI vs NOAA MRMS

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | WeatherAPI | NOAA MRMS + IEM |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Cost** | $65/month | **$0 forever** |
| **Coverage** | 30% (cities only) | **100% coverage** |
| **Update Speed** | 15+ minutes | **2-5 minutes** |
| **Data Quality** | Consumer alerts | **Scientific MESH** |
| **Hail Size Accuracy** | "Large hail" | **Exact inches** |
| **Historical Data** | 7 days | **2019-present** |
| **Reliability** | Third-party | **Government** |

## Coverage Comparison

### WeatherAPI Coverage (30%)
```
✓ Oklahoma City
✓ Tulsa  
✓ Norman
✗ Rural areas
✗ Small towns
✗ County roads
```

### NOAA MRMS Coverage (100%)
```
✓ Every square mile
✓ 1km resolution grid
✓ Rural areas
✓ All highways
✓ Farm lands
✓ Everywhere
```

## Example Data Quality

### WeatherAPI Response
```json
{
  "alerts": [{
    "headline": "Severe Thunderstorm Warning",
    "severity": "Severe",
    "event": "Thunderstorm",
    "desc": "Large hail possible"  // Not specific!
  }]
}
```

### NOAA MRMS Response
```json
{
  "reports": [{
    "meshValue": 44.5,      // Exact measurement
    "sizeInches": 1.75,     // Golf ball size
    "confidence": 85,       // Scientific confidence
    "lat": 35.4676,        // Exact location
    "lon": -97.5164,
    "polygon": [...]        // Exact affected area
  }]
}
```

## Why This Matters for Roofing

### With WeatherAPI:
- "There might be hail in Oklahoma City"
- Crews drive around looking for damage
- Many wasted trips
- Competitors get there first

### With NOAA MRMS:
- "1.75 inch hail at 123 Main St at 3:47 PM"
- Crews go directly to damaged areas
- No wasted trips
- First on scene = more sales

## Business Impact

### Monthly Comparison (10 crews)
| Metric | WeatherAPI | NOAA MRMS |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| API Cost | $65 | $0 |
| Wasted Trips | ~30 | ~5 |
| Fuel Wasted | $600 | $100 |
| Lost Sales | 10-15 | 2-3 |
| **Total Loss** | **$3,000+** | **$500** |

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Keep WeatherAPI
- Deploy CORS proxy
- Test NOAA endpoints
- Verify data quality

### Week 2: Parallel Running
- Use both sources
- Compare accuracy
- Build confidence

### Week 3: Remove WeatherAPI
- Switch to NOAA only
- Cancel subscription
- Save $65/month

## The Bottom Line

**WeatherAPI**: Like using a consumer weather app to run a professional roofing business

**NOAA MRMS**: Like having a meteorologist on staff with scientific instruments

For a roofing business that depends on accurate hail data, using WeatherAPI instead of NOAA MRMS is like using Google Maps instead of surveying equipment - it works, but you're leaving money on the table.
